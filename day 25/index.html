                    <p><b>Visual Studio Code</b> was made by <b>Microsoft</b> for <b>Windows, macOS and  Linux.</b> It was used for coding. In <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, you could make a lot of types of files (for ex: <b>Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Java</b> and much more.. you can even post these codes on <b>GitHub</b> and you can download <b>extensions</b> to make coding easier. you can even change themes to dark to light, and you can even make multiple files and place it to different places to make barrier between two files.. this makes coding much easier.                 <center><img src="images/VScode.png" alt="Error: Check  code and try again."></center>
